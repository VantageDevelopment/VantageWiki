# Shop

![/shop GUI](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-01-17 004445.png>)

The `/shop` GUI has a number of different categories, each of which is filled with items that can be bought or sold. You can also open a specific category using the command `/shop <category` (for example, `/shop blocks` would open the Blocks shop).

Some shops require special permissions to use. For example, the Commands shop has certain items that can only be used after prestiging.
