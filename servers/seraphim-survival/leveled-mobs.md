# Leveled Mobs

Unlike vanilla Minecraft, naturally-spawning hostile mobs are leveled, meaning they have increased speed, health, and damage. Levels are based on nearby players' class levels, and max out at 100.

Leveled mobs give a level bonus when killed. Spawner mobs are not leveled and have no AI.
