# Chest Sorting

The Chest Sorting plugin allows players to sort chests, barrels, inventories, etc., without any client-side mods. You can choose different modes, such as auto-sorting, command-based, or inventory-action.

The chest contents are sorted by category and/or alphabetically and stackable things will be stacked. By default, items will be put before blocks. Automatic sorting will work with chests, enderchests, shulker boxes, barrels, minecarts with chest and player inventories. The same applies to using hotkeys.

## Changing Your Sorting Options

You can modify your hotkeys in the `/sort` GUI.

### Automatic Sorting

You can enable/disable automatic chest sorting using the command:\
`/sort on|off|toggle`.

You can enable/disable automatic inventory sorting using the command:

`/invsort on|off|toggle`.

### Inventory Sorting

You can sort your inventory (minus the hotbar) using the command `/invsort`.

To sort just the hotbar, use `/invsort hotbar`.

To sort the inventory (including the hotbar) use `/invsort all`.

## Hotkeys
