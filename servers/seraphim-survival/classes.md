# Classes

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

## Class Types

There are three classes available in `/class` (Warrior, Marksman, Mage). Each comes with some upsides and downsides, so itâ€™s up to you which one to use. You can view specific stats in `/class`, but the overall info is below:

**The Warrior class** has increased attack damage, attack speed, health, speed malus reduction (negates speed decreases from heavy armor), and lowers overall movement speed.

**The Marksman class** has increased knockback resistance and speed malus reduction, along with lower max health and movement speed.

**The Mage class** has increased mana regeneration, health regeneration, and max mana, along with lower max health.

## Class Points

To change your class, you need a class point. Every new player starts with one class point, but you will get another every 5 times you rank up with `/rankup`.
