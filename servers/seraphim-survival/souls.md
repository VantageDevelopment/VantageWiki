Souls are a custom currency system that works alongside the regular economy. When killing mobs, there is a 10% chance that they will drop a head. If they do, you can sell it in `/shop souls` for one soul.

You need to reach a certain number of souls to unlock new Realms, and can redeem them on page 2 of the Souls shop for various consumables.
