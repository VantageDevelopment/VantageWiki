# Grief Prevention

Grief Prevention will allow players to claim land with a claim shovel obtained from /kit claim or a normal golden shovel. Players can check claimed land with a claim info stick from /kit claim.

A claim will automatically be created in a 9 x 9 area centered around the first chest placed in the world. Players can also use /claim to create a 9x9 claim and resize it with a claim shovel. Additionally, players can create a claim by marking 2 opposite corners with the claim shovel to make a rectangular claim.

Unless explicitly given permission by a claim owner, players are not allowed to build within 200 blocks of that claim.

Claims protect all land inside the claim up to the claim border, and griefing around claim borders is strictly prohibited.
