## Ranks

There are 10 ranks total, each of which has its own perks. Players can rank up for a set price using `/rankup`. For more details on each rank's perks, check `/ranks`.

## Prestiges

After reaching rank 10, you can prestige and start back at rank 1. Most of your perms will be reset, but you get a few perks as well, such as more homes, playervaults, running tax-exempt auctions, verifying your clans, and the ability to buy 30 mins of fly from shop.
