# Mob Hunting

Mob Hunting rewards players for killing mobs. Each mob has a set reward range. This, combined with your rank and any other multipliers will combine into the final amount you receive.

To disable Mob Hunting chat messages, use `/mh mute`.

Some mobs have a 10% chance of dropping their heads, which can be traded for Souls at `/shop souls`.
